This is a classic Rock Paper Scissors game built using Python's Tkinter library. The player chooses rock, paper, or scissors by clicking a button, and the computer makes a random choice. The game then displays the result of the round along with the updated scores for both the player and the computer.

Libraries Used:
- tkinter (for creating the graphical user interface)
- random (for generating the computer's random move)

Features:
- Real-time score tracking for user and computer
- Clear GUI with buttons for user interaction
- Game logic using modular arithmetic for determining winner

Note:
- Each result appears in a text area within the application window.
